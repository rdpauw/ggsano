# ggsano

<<<<<<< HEAD
The goal of ggsano is to uniform the use of colours within the institue Sciensano. The ggsano package is open-source and can be downloaded by everyone. Currently the package only includes a discrete and continuous color palette, but regular updates are planned.

## Installation

Since ggsano is not available on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org), you can download  the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) by executing the following code:

## Installation

You can install the released version of ggsano from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("ggsano")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rdpauw/ggsano")
```
## Example

<<<<<<< HEAD
This is are the standard discrete colours included in the ggsano package:

```{r example}
library(ggsano)
library(scales)
show_col(pal_sciensano()(12))
```

You can specify the colours in each row by specifying the `name` argument in the functions

```{r cars}
show_col(pal_sciensano(name = "yellow")(4))
```

=======
This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(ggsano)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
